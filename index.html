       <h2 id="news1"><b>Ethiopia declares state of emergency as Tigrayan forces gain ground</b></h2>
       The announcement came two days after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed urged citizens to take up arms to defend themselves against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).<br><br>
       <p> 03 Nov,2021: Ethiopia declared a six-month state of emergency on Tuesday after forces from the northern region of Tigray said they were gaining territory and considering marching on the capital Addis Ababa.

       The announcement came two days after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed urged citizens to take up arms to defend themselves against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF).

       Earlier on Tuesday, authorities in Addis Ababa told residents to register their arms and prepare to defend their neighbourhoods.</p>


       <p> The state of emergency was imposed with immediate effect after the TPLF claimed to have captured several towns in recent days and said it might march on Addis Ababa, about 380 km (235 miles) to the south of their forward positions.

        “Our country is facing a grave danger to its existence, sovereignty and unity. And we can’t dispel this danger through the usual law enforcement systems and procedures,” Justice Minister Gedion Timothewos told a state media briefing.

        He said anyone violating the emergency would face three to 10 years in prison, for offences such as providing financial, material or moral support to “terrorist groups”.</p>


        <p> move came after the Tigrayan fighters said they had captured the strategic towns of Dessie and Kombolcha in the neighbouring Amhara region in recent days, and also indicated they might advance further south, on Addis Ababa.

        The government said soldiers were still battling for control for the two key towns, some 400km (250 miles) from the capital.

        Much of northern Ethiopia is under a communications blackout and access for journalists is restricted, making battlefield claims difficult to verify independently.</p>

   <h2 id="news2"> 1 billion doses: How India's Covid vaccine campaign compares to others </h2>



  <p>  India on Thursday reached the milestone of one billion Covid vaccines in a little over nine months, commemorating the occasion by unfurling the national flag at the Red Fort and lighting up around 100 heritage monuments in the country in saffron, white, and green.

    India has administered the second-highest number of doses in the world, next only to China, which is said to have given over 2.2 billion doses to its citizens.
    
    “Today — October 21 — has been registered in history. The country has the protective shield of 100 crore doses to protect us from a once in a century pandemic,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet.
    
    Nearly 31 per cent of the adult population is now reportedly fully vaccinated while 75 per cent has received their first dose.

  </p>




  <p>The average daily vaccination doses delivered, on a seven-day moving average basis, have slowed from 8.4 million daily at the end of August to around 5 million. The challenge is to ensure everyone takes his or her second dose in time.

    Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said: “Completion of second dose for those people whose second dose is due is the next challenge.”</p>

  <p>Nearly 90% of the vaccines administered in India have come from the Serum Institute of India (SII), which produces a licensed version of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) drug. SII has more than tripled its capacity since April and can now produce 220 million vaccine doses a month.

    The World Health Organization (WHO), which relies heavily on India for supplies to its global vaccine-sharing platform COVAX, congratulated the country for reaching the landmark.

    "India's progress must be viewed in the context of the country's commendable commitment and efforts to ensure that these life-saving vaccines are accessible globally," said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director WHO South-East Asia.

    COVAX partner UNICEF also congratulated India and said it looked forward to "hearing details about the expected timeline and volumes of supplies to be made" to the global facility.</p>
